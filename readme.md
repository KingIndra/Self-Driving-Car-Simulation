- This simulation is built with using HTML Canvas Element

- Car drives in a straight road and avoid collisions with traffic and road borders.
- Implemented a Neural Network from scratch in JavaScript to enable autonomous driving.
- Developed user-friendly interface allowing users to launch multiple cars with custom speed and random network parameters.
- Implemented friction and acceleration to make car movements look real.
- Implemented device orientation and key controls for car
